## Summary ##

The goal of this project is to develop a simple, two-user game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game must have an interactive input field and a graphical display of the game that is updated to reflect the current state of the game.

## User Story ##

This game will be played by two human users. One player will be randomly selected to select a symbol and go first. They will take turns selecting their Tic-Tac-Toe spaces via an input field. The graphics display will update the board after each turn. After the game is complete, the computer will verify if any player won the game and if they did declare them the winner.

## Requirements ##

 * The game shall be written using Python
 * The game shall be playable from the terminal window
 * The terminal window shall display a Tic-Tac-Toe grid comprised of ASCII characters
 * The terminal window shall update the state of the game after each user takes their turn
 * The terminal window shall only accept numeric inputs in the range [1, 9] and reject invalid inputs of any other kind
 * The program shall assess the board at the conclusion of a game and correctly declare a winner (if there is one)

## Development Management Plan ##

The code will be written using the Sublime IDE and version controlled using GitHub. The artifacts of this project will be kept in this repo.
